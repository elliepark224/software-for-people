  <h1>Pasatiempo Lane</h1>

    ^^ this is supposed to be reminiscient of a street sign. eventually I might put in a real pic

    I am creating this collection as a means of housing remnants of my childhood memories.
    This collection is for myself. My parents moved out of my childhood home earlier this month and I guess I'm a bit #emo about it.
    I grew up on a street called Pasatiempo Lane - which translates to pasttime - but I often think of it as the passage of time.
    So in a sense, I want this project to be taking a trip down memory lane.
    As I examine what it means for a place to feel like home and see what things I've held onto physically and what things I have had to let go, I'm collecting all the things that make me feel nostalgic for some place I will never be again.
    This is my way of making a new space for these things to live on. I'm finding new home for these memories - the web.
    <br><br> &#128515; Here are all of my collection entries! Yay! &#128515;
