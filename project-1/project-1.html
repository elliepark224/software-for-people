      <h1>Project 1 Page</h1>
      <p>I am creating this collection as a means of housing remnants of my childhood memories.
        This collection is for myself. My parents moved out of my childhood home earlier this month and I guess I'm a bit #emo about it.
        I grew up on a street called Pasatiempo Lane, which translates to pastime, but I often think of it as the passage of time.
        So in a sense, I want this project to be taking a trip down memory lane.
        As I examine what it means for a place to feel like home and see what things I've held onto physically and what things I have had to let go, I'm collecting all the things that make me feel nostalgic for some place I will never be again.
        This is my way of making a new space for these things to live on. I'm finding a new home for these memories - the web.</p>
