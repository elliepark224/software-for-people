  <h2> Pink zebra Justice chair </h2>
  <p> The second entry in my collection is my <b>pink zebra Justice chair</b> that I have had since elementary school. For context, it looks like <a href= "https://www.pinterest.com/pin/justice-3--346847608772822039/">this</a>.<br>I told my parents they could throw it out because it is so old. But when I think about what makes my room <i> my room</i>, this chair is definitely a highlight.<br>I no longer can access my childhood bedroom in person, but this chair is what lives on in my memory.
