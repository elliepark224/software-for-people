            <p>
                I didn't actually have a dog growing up. My parents and younger sister got one after I went to college. But hanging out with our dog, Coco, has become a primary activity for me whenever I go home for break. She'll be waiting for me at the new house, but I wanted to take a photo of her to remember our time together in our old home.
