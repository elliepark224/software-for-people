            <p>
                I played piano since I was four years old. I remember stumbling into the "piano room," where my older sister was playing this upright piano, and I told my mom that I would also like to take piano lessons. I played piano for about a decade, until I quit and switched to violin. I still enjoy playing for fun every once in a while, whether at home, or just on my suitemate's keyboard. So when my parents asked me what they should do with the piano, i.e. if they should get rid of it, I said PLEASE KEEP IT! And they did, thankfully.
