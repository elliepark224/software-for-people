                Agendas by which I remember my K-12 days
            </h2>
            <p>
                I have a bunch of middle school and high school agendas left from my K-12 days. I can't believe I used to write stuff down. Today, I can't live without my GCal! These agendas detail all the to-do's that kept me busy while I lived in this house. Chemistry assignments, orchestra rehearsals, Latin vocab quizzes. I am glad to be out of that era, but I am also glad to have these tangible records of how I spent my time in this house.
