               When I visited home for breaks, we went on daily evening walks with our puppy. Our route was usually the same - two laps around the most central part of our neighborhood. I will miss the familiarity of the route - the houses, the scents, the people and pets we met along the way. This past summer I took a lot of photos on these evening walks, knowing that this would be the last summer I spent here.
