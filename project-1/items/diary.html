                A diary by which I remember my childhood days
            </h2>
            <p>
                I logged my playdates with friends, days at school, lessons for piano and swim, etc. I no longer write a consistent diary, but looking back on my childhood diaries, I feel like I should. Because I wrote in these, I can somewhat remember how I spent these younger days.
