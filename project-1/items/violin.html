            <p>
                I played violin for almost a decade. There was a moment in elementary school when I quit because I hated practicing. lol. I then picked it up again in middle school because my middle school had an orchestra program and that seemed exciting. Playing violin in orchestras and string quartets became an integral part of my high school experience and my youth at large. I spent a lot of time at home practicing and playing in string quartets with friends.
