  <h2> Polaroid of my dog </h2>
  <p> The first entry in my collection is a <b> Polaroid photo of my dog </b> that my Mom took. I had asked her to take a Polaroid photo of me holding my dog in my bedroom before I left for college and before my parents moved out of my childhood room. After I put my dog back down on the floor, my mom spontaneously snapped a shot of my dog looking up at her. I like this photo because it captures <i> the exact angle </i> that I usually see my dog at. I brought this photo with me to college and put it on my desk. Something to remember my dog and my life at home by.
